Why use the Debugger?

# The promise

 - JavaScript is rapidly becoming a relevant language in a variety of domains:
   - Not just websites anymore!
   - Presentations
   - Data Viz
   - Atom text editor: example of taking browser model to the desktop
 - Even if you don't want to use JavaScript at all, it's a great way to dig into
   asynchronous programming (where code is executed in response to events as
   opposed to in a linear fashion)

# The difficulty

 - JavaScript is complex, wild west execution model
 - Even foundational programming steps, like importing libraries, are shifting
   to asynchronous execution.

# The solution(s)

 - The debugger allows us to pause, even in the middle of complex, async code!
 - The JS Console also allows us to experiment and see what effects of
   javascript calls would be *immediately*
