javascript-viz
==============

This is a repository taking ideas from @rdhyee's [2014 Working with Open Data
class](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014). We present the basics
of using Javascript to plot and map things, starting with IPython notebooks,
then graduating to understanding how you'd coordinate that on your own with a
server.

Using the IPython notebook
--------------------------

This course won't use much python. BUT, it turns out the IPython notebook is a
generally useful place to write all kinds of code. JavaScript can melt your
brain. IPython can cool it off.

We'll also use the python interpreter to lauch a SimpleHTTPServer, this will
provide us with a simple example of how we might work in a "real" networked
situation.

Learning Javascript
-------------------

There are many resources to learning javascript. The following is probably not
the best, but it (like the IPython notebook) provides an *executable* textbook:
